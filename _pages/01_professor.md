**Haedong Jeong, Ph.D.**
<br>haedong@sogang.ac.kr

I am an assistant professor at Sogang University.
My primary research interests include understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks, designing metrics to evaluate the creativity of generative modelsâ€™ outputs, and developing human-aligned generative models.
I am also interested in exploring the intersection of art and deep learning, particularly in artistically visualizing the internal workings of neural networks. By creatively presenting these mechanisms, I aims to make complex AI systems more interpretable and inspire innovation in generative models.

Previously, I worked as a staff researcher at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), where I focused on developing human-aligned generative models to innovate the semiconductor patterning process.
I received my Ph.D. degrees from UNIST under the supervision of Jaesik Choi (Graduate School of AI at KAIST)

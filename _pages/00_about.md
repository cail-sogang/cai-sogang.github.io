**Creative Artificial Intelligence (CAI) Lab (@ Dept. of Art & Technology, Sogang University)** explores how generative AI can enhance human creativity and redefine human-computer collaboration. Our research focuses on making deep learning models more interpretable, as we believe that understanding their internal decision mechanisms is the first step toward building reliable, human-aligned AI systems.

We are particularly interested in:

1. **Explainable AI (XAI) techniques** to uncover the reasoning behind AI decisions.
2. **Generative models** (e.g., Text-to-Image models, Large Language Models) that inspire and amplify human creativity.
3. **Creativity evaluation metrics** to systematically measure and improve AI-driven creative processes.

By bridging AI interpretability and generative creativity, we aim to develop AI tools that empower artists, designers, and creators to push the boundaries of innovation.
